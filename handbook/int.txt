44      0                   shutdown
44      1                   hold - keep running but stop executing code, useful for debugging

45      0       r1, r2      get uptime and store seconds in r1, milliseconds in r2
45      1       r1          get unix timestamp and store in r1
45      2       r1          set unix timestamp to r1

46      2                   unmask all masked ints
47      0       r1, r2, r3  read r3 number of sectors from permanent storage, read starting from sector r1 and write starting from mem page r2
47      1       r1, r2, r3  write r3 number of sectors to permanent storage, read starting from mem page r1 and write starting from sector r2
48      (sel)               set frame buffer - selects frame buffer to draw from
