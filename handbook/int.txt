code    func    args        description

40      (sel)   r1, (r2)    set pit channel (sel) interval to r1 (set amount of times to activate to r2, if applicable)
41      (sel)   r1          set pit channel (sel) mode to r1
42      (sel)               trigger pit channel
43      (sel)   r1          set operation variable (sel) to r1
44      0                   shutdown
44      1                   hold - keep running but stop executing code, useful for debugging
44      2                   reboot - fully shut down and boot again
45      0       r1, r2      get uptime and store seconds in r1, milliseconds in r2
46      0       r1          mask hardware int r1
46      1       r1          unmask hardware int r1
46      2                   unmask all masked ints

47      0       r1, r2, r3  read r3 number of sectors from permanent storage, read starting from sector r1 and write starting from mem page r2
47      1       r1, r2, r3  write r3 number of sectors to permanent storage, read starting from mem page r1 and write starting from sector r2
