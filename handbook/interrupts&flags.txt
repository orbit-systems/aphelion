interrupt instructions have imm20 as an argument listed in instructions.txt. 
this is technically correct because the format B supports a 20-bit immediate value. 
however, only the least significant 8 bits are used by the processor to select an interrupt.

hardware interrupt table
	set interval timer channel
	interval timer signal
	input detected
	shutdown
	hold (endlessly loop)
	reboot (fully shut down and restart)
	get uptime (sec component)
	get uptime (ms component)
	1 second tick
	get timestamp
	set timestamp

	read sector(s) to permanent storage
	write sector(s) to permanent storage

	set frame buffer (selects frame buffer to draw from)

exception interrupts (available in all modes)
	segfault - attempt to access unowned memory
	segfault - unable to allocate memory [out of memory]
	integer overflow
	integer underflow
	divide by zero
	unmapped opcode (also triggered when running kernel-only instructions in user mode)
	no permission
	stack underflow (raises if sp < fp)
	general/unknown error

status register bit flags
	sign
	zero
	parity (0 if even, 1 if odd)
	carry
	borrow
	equal
	greater
	less
	greater (unsigned)
	less (unsigned)
	mode [kernel/user]
