programmable interval timer

the PIT has 4 independent channels:
	A channel can count based on millisecond ticks or clock signals.
	A channel can be set to disabled(off), trigger once(echo), trigger a set number of times(for), or trigger until stopped(loop).
	setting an PIT channel's interval or mode puts the channel in idle. To start a channel, use INT 41 with the channel number in the func argument.
