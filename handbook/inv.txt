inv - invalid instruction

on hardware, this instruction will generate an 'invalid opcode' exception, no matter what.
on the emulator, you may provide it with arguments to make use of debug functions, which are provided by the emulator
to make development easier.

the default state for the `inv` instruction will trigger an 'invalid opcode' exception. in order to use a debug function,
you must explicitly provide it with arguments.
