ACCESSABLE REGISTERS:

code	name    description

0       rz      always 0, writes silently fail
1-B     r[a-k]  general purpose
C       pc      program counter
D       sp      stack pointer
E       fp      frame pointer
F       st      status register, contains bit flags and information abt the processor state

pc, sp, fp, and st are all read-only unless in real mode. attempting to write to these will trigger a "no permission" error interrupt.

reminder that fp and st are initialized to 0 and that the stack expands downward. in order to use the stack, you must use reloc to place the stack somewhere specific.

INACCESSABLE REGISTERS: (operation variables)

0       IDT pointer
1       syscall handler pointer
2       hardware interrupt masks
