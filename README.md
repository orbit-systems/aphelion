# Aphelion
Aphelion is a RISC instruction set architecture built for low-bloat, high performance 64-bit computing. It's a hobby project, meant as a continuation to [Aphelion16](https://github.com/technichron/aphelion16)(previously called Aphelion).

It is currently in the planning phase. Feel free to contribute ideas and code!
