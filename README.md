# Aphelion
Aphelion is a RISC instruction set architecture built for low-bloat, high performance 64-bit computing. It's a hobby project, meant as a continuation to [Aphelion16](https://github.com/spsandwichman/aphelion16)(previously called Aphelion).

It is currently in `v0.1` and incomplete. I don't know why you'd try to build it, but if you do, make sure you have the [Odin compiler](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) installed, then run `make`. Feel free to contribute ideas and code!
