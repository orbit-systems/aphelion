# Aphelion
Aphelion is a 64-bit RISC-like instruction set architecture. Aphelion aims to be a clean and featureful architecture without succumbing to paralyzing minimalism or unwieldy complexity, walking a line between CISC and RISC conventions. Aphelion is meant for high-performance native-64-bit computing while staying easy to implement.

Aphelion is under active development. If you have
